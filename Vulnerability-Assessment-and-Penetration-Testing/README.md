# Vulnerability Assessment and Penetration Testing

## Overview
This project involves conducting a comprehensive vulnerability assessment and penetration testing on Windows Server 2016 and Metasploitable 2 environments. The assessment was performed using Nessus and Metasploit to identify and exploit vulnerabilities.

## Tools and Technologies
- **Nessus**: Used for vulnerability scanning.
- **Metasploit**: Used for exploiting identified vulnerabilities.
- **Kali Linux**: Used as the attacker machine.
- **Metasploitable 2**: Used as the target machine.

## Project Steps
1. **Setting Up Environments**:
   - Installed Windows Server 2016 and configured network settings.
   - Deployed Metasploitable 2 as a vulnerable target machine.
   - Set up Kali Linux with Nessus and Metasploit.

2. **Vulnerability Scanning with Nessus**:
   - Scanned both Windows Server 2016 and Metasploitable 2.
   - Identified multiple vulnerabilities, including critical ones.

3. **Exploiting Vulnerabilities with Metasploit**:
   - Exploited the UnrealIRCd backdoor on Metasploitable 2.
   - Gained unauthorized access and documented the exploitation process.

## Key Findings
- **UnrealIRCd Backdoor**:
  - Description: Remote code execution vulnerability in UnrealIRCd 3.2.8.1.
  - Impact: Allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary commands.
  - Exploit: Successfully exploited using Metasploit.

- **Other Findings**:
  - SMB signing not required on Windows Server 2016.
  - ICMP timestamp responses on Windows Server 2016.

## Recommendations
1. **Update UnrealIRCd**: Upgrade to a version that does not contain the backdoor.
2. **Enforce SMB Signing**: Configure SMB signing to prevent man-in-the-middle attacks.
3. **Filter ICMP Timestamp Requests**: Prevent potential information disclosure by filtering ICMP timestamp requests.
4. **Conduct regular vulnerability assessments and apply patches promptly**.
